Itâ€™s one of those warm, flat British beers that your grandfather complained about after the war. From the BJCP:
> A low-alcohol, malty beer with light caramel, toast, toffee, and fruit
> flavors. A slight roast dryness offsets the residual sweetness in the finish,
> with the bitterness perceived only to keep the beer from being cloying.
