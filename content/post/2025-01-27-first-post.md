After pouring at the 2025 [Paws for
Pints](https://animalshelterfoundation.org/events/pints-for-paws-2025/) charity
last Saturday, Kelly and I decided that it would be fun to participate in more
festivals like that. The format of the event required that we have a name for
the brewery, and after looking at the cool style of the other homebrewers, we
decided to go ahead and make it official. Hence, the Baker family homebrewery
is now officially **Flame Point Brewing**. 

I've created this site as a location to collect information about our beers and
the events where we've participated or are planning to participate. If you have
any questions, feel free to reach out to us at
[info@flamepointbrewing.com](mailto:info@flamepointbrewing.com). Otherwise,
stay tuned to the website for updates!
