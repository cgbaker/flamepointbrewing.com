First brewed as "Hearth Hound" for the 2025 Pints for Paws charity benefiting
the Tallahassee Animal Shelter Foundation, this beer was a surprise hit at the
show. A historical Polish beer called Grodziskie (or Gr√§tzer), our version is brewed
with oak-smoked wheat malt and Saaz hops. Despite the wheat, it's as clear as
any American Lager, and despite the smoky aroma, it's a highly refreshing beer,
with a moderate hop bitterness, that keeps you coming back for another pint.
