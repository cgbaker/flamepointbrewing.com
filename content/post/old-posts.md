This site was created to concentrate homebrewing efforts and allow folks to
track past and upcoming events. However, I previously posted about brewing on
my personal webpage at [cgbaker.net](https://cgbaker.net), and there may be
some posts of interest over there under the [homebrew
category](https://www.cgbaker.net/categories/#posts-list-homebrew).

Specifically, consider the following posts:
* [Return to Brewing](https://www.cgbaker.net/2017/02/return-to-brewing-english-dark-mild/): 
  Where I discuss my return to homebrewing and my first batch of the [English Dark Mild]({{< ref "beers/mild-child" >}}).
* [Adding Heating to the IceMaster Max 2](https://www.cgbaker.net/2021/01/adding-heating-to-the-icemaster-max-2/): 
  Where I discuss the modifications to my glycol chiller (specifically, the included temperature controllers) in order to 
  add support for heating my fermenter.
* [The Why and How of My Unitank](https://www.cgbaker.net/2021/04/the-why-and-how-of-my-unitank/):
  Where I describe all of the benefits that I get from fermenting in a unitank.
