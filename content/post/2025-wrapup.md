As 2025 comes to a close, I wanted to take a second to reflect on those beer
aspects of the past year.

<!--more--> 

When Tim Rach invited us to pour beer at [Pints for
Paws]({{< ref 2025-01-29-2025-pints-for-paws >}}), I don't think I would have
imagined how the rest of the year would go. Kelly and I rolled up to P4P with a
[Pivo Grodziskie]({{< ref grodziskie >}}) and an [Italian Pilsner]({{< ref bella-ciao >}}); before the end of the year, I saw
another Grodziskie (at TLH Beer Festival), and every subsequent festival has
seen multiple Italian Pils on tap. We started with an old jockey box and hand-made signs; we finished with a website, swag, and a social media presence.

I poured with Kelly in Gainesville at Hogtown Beer Festival; with Brian and
Dustin at Tallahassee Beer Festival; and with Dustin at St. Marks Beer
Festival. In total, we brewed 30 gallons of [Italian Pilsner]({{< ref
bella-ciao >}}); 10 gallons of [Dark Mild]({{< ref mild-child >}}); 30 gallons
of [Grodziskie]({{< ref grodziskie >}}), not counting [Ale Pastor]({{< ref
ale-pastor >}}); and a [peach hefe]({{< ref peachy-keen >}}). I suspect the
other members of the [NFBL](https://nfbl.org/) will be glad if I never brew
another smoked beer.

Despite all of the work involved in brewing for and pouring at these festivals,
it's been a great pleasure to reenage with the local beer community, catching
up with some old friends and making new ones. Even as more craft breweries open
in the tri-state region, it's amazing to me the energy that the local
homebrewers bring to the beer scene. I am continuously inspired by the
craft and creativity of the other brewers in the NFBL, and I can't wait to
see/drink what they're cooking up for 2026.

So, as we prepare to kick off 2026 with the next [Pints for Paws](https://www.facebook.com/events/629824310181940/), 
we wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year! Sláinte!
