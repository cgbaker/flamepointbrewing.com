First brewed as "Hearth Hound" for the 2025 Pints for Paws charity benefiting the Tallahassee Animal Shelter Foundation, this beer was a surprised hit at the show. A historical Polish called Grodziskie (or Gr√§tzer), our version is brewed with oak-smoked wheat malt and Saaz hops. Despite the wheat, it's as clear as any American Lager, and despite the smoky aroma, it's a highly refreshing beer, with a moderate hop bitterness.
