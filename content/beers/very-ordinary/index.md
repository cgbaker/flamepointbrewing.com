This was another beer in our exploration of the low-gravity British styles. It
was also an attempt to break away from making the Dark Mild over and over
again. We kegged this in the historical style, with very little carbonation and
served at 55ÂªF. The result was a flavorful beer that wasn't filling, as great
session beer.
