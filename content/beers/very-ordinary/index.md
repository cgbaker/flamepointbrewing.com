This was another beer in our exploration of the low-gravity British styles. It
was also an attempt to break away from repeated batches of the [Dark Mild]({{<
ref "mild-child" >}}). We kegged this in the historical style, with very little
carbonation, and served it at 55ÂªF. The result was a flavorful beer that wasn't
filling, a great session beer.
