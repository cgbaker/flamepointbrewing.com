Things are not what they appear with this pale lager. Per the BJCP:

> A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.

Our love for Czech beers was inspired by a trip to the OG, Pilsner Urquell in Plze≈à, CZ. This is our go-to lager at Flame Point.
