Low hops. Low carbonation. Low alcohol. Youâ€™ll just have to drink a bunch of them. Per the BJCP:

> A dark, low-gravity, malt-focused British session ale readily suited to drinking in quantity. Refreshing, yet flavorful for its strength, with a wide range of dark malt or dark sugar expression.

Our #1 ale at Flame Point, this is the beer that we are most likely to have on tap at home.
