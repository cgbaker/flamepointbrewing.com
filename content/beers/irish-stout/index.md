The name of the beer is a pun from my time working on [HashiCorp
Nomad](https://nomadproject.io/). It refers to the fact that this beer was my
first ever stuck sparge, resulting in two gallons of wort staying in the mash
tun. That, plus a bad gravity calculation during top-up, meant that this beer
came in well short of the intended 1.036 original gravity and 3.6% ABV.
Regardless, it was a great-tasting beer. I'm planning to make it again for St.
Paddy's Day, and it will probably get a new name.
