An attempt to branch out a bit from our [Czech Pilzner]({{< ref "czech-again"
>}}), this Italian Pilsner was a hit when we first poured it as "Paws & Pils"
at the [2025 Pints for Paws](/post/2025-01-29-2025-pints-for-paws/) charity
festival. Similar to a German pilsner, it differentiates itself with dose of
aroma courtesy of dry-hopped Saphir hops.
