## Flame Point Brewing

**Proprieters**: Chris and Kelly Baker \
**Brewing Club**: [North Florida Brewers League](https://nfbl.org/)

We are a home brewery operating in Marianna, FL since 2019. 
We specialize in low-gravity beers (typically around 3% ABV) influenced
by traditional styles. We brew for friends and family, and we
serve our beers at charity events around Northwest Florida.

### Our History

Chris began homebrewing after moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico, inspired by
coworkers at [Sandia National Labs](https://sandia.gov) and members of the
[Dukes of Ale Homebrew Club](https://www.dukesofale.com/). Carrying this hobby
with them to Knoxville, TN, onto Tallahassee, FL, and eventually back to
Marianna, FL, we have continuously focused on brewing accessible session
beers that may not be commercially available. Alongside occasional stints
helping out at [Southern Fields Brewing
Company](https://www.southernfieldsbrewingco.com/), Chris enjoys brewing small
batches in the garage and serving them with Kelly wherever we get the chance.
